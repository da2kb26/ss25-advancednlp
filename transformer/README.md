# Transformer-based Encoder

This module implements a **Transformer-based encoder** for binary sentiment classification.

The model is trained on the shared dataset located in the `../data/` folder, which includes labeled sentences from Amazon, IMDB, and Yelp.

## ðŸ“¦ How to Run

1. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch stanza scikit-learn
```

2. Run the model training and prediction:

```bash
python transformer.py
```

After training, you'll be prompted to input your own sentences for live sentiment prediction.
